# Glossary

## Application Root

The place where your HIVE installation resides.

## Comment

A line of code that is ignored by the parser/interpreter/processor/compiler. Usually used to identify what a specific line or section of code does. Used to help keep code clean and organized.

## Enterprise networking

A specific type of network that is built to support hundreds or even thousands of users at one with minimum down-time. Often requires higher-end hardware than can be found on the consumer market.

## HIVE

The engine that manages node connections and load distribution

## HIVIL

The scripting language and interpreter that drives the HIVE engine

## Interpreted

Source code that is converted into machine code in real-time. HIVIL is an example of an interpreted language.

## Key

The name of a setting. Can also be the unique ID for each entry in a database.

## Latency

The higher latency you have, the longer it takes a packet to travel across the network to its specified destination.

## Master node

The node on which the source script and the variable store resides.

## Node

Any computer that has HIVE installed.

## Race condition

When two parallel tasks 'race' to affect the outcome of a process. Can lead to confusing and fatal errors if not accounted for in program coding. In a HIVE environment, race conditions are usually caused by network issues.

## SWAP space

A file on a hard drive that acts like an extension of RAM. Can be useful in many applications, but it can be detrimental in high-speed applications.

## Slave node

A node that only carries out script instructions, referring to the master node for variables and external scripts.

## Value

An attribute that is added to a key of some kind.

## Virtualization

A software-based or hardware-based method of allowing multiple instances of an operating system to share the same physical computing resources.

## Ping

The time in milliseconds it takes for a packet to travel across the network.
